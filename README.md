<h1>Quizzler</h1>
<p><br>A quiz game with the only answer possibilities: True or False - with dynamic download of questions from the trivia database, coded in python as brought to me inside udemy course "100 Days of Python".
<p>The game ends when the user has answered all questions.</p>
<p>The implementation uses tkinter graphics and the requests module. Data come from https://opentdb.com/api.php.
By default 10 questions from the field: Computer/Science are fetched from the database</p>
